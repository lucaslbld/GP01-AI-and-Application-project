## I. Introduction

### Motivation
In recent years, the rapid development of generative AI systems—such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, DALL·E, and more recently Sora has completely transformed the way digital content is created and shared. Access to these technologies has become extremely easy for the general public. While this accessibility brings many positive opportunities, it also raises serious concerns, especially regarding misinformation, content authenticity, and the spread of manipulated media.

Generative models have become so advanced that it is increasingly difficult for humans to distinguish AI-generated images from real photographs. On social networks, misleading or entirely fabricated content can circulate faster than verified information, amplifying the risk of confusion and intentional deception. As a result, it is now more important than ever to develop automated tools capable of identifying whether an image is real or produced by AI.

Such detection systems could eventually be integrated into social media platforms to automatically verify uploaded content and require AI-generated images to be clearly labeled. This would contribute to transparency, trust, and safer digital ecosystems.

### Project Goal
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of determining whether an image is a real photograph or generated by artificial intelligence. To achieve this, we will build a complete end-to-end pipeline: collecting and describing the dataset, preprocessing and preparing the images, extracting relevant features, training classification models, and evaluating their performance. The aim is to explore how machine learning can support digital authenticity and contribute to future systems that automatically detect AI-generated visual content.
