## Introduction

### Motivation
In recent years, the rapid development of generative AI systems such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, DALL·E, and more recently Sora has completely transformed the way digital content is created and shared. Access to these technologies has become extremely easy for the general public. While this accessibility brings many positive opportunities, it also raises serious concerns, especially regarding misinformation, content authenticity, and the spread of manipulated media.

Generative models have become so advanced that it is increasingly difficult for humans to distinguish AI-generated images from real photographs. On social networks, misleading or entirely fabricated content can circulate faster than verified information, amplifying the risk of confusion and intentional deception. As a result, it is now more important than ever to develop automated tools capable of identifying whether an image is real or produced by AI.

Such detection systems could eventually be integrated into social media platforms to automatically verify uploaded content and require AI-generated images to be clearly labeled. This would contribute to transparency, trust, and safer digital ecosystems.

### Project Goal
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of determining whether an image is a real photograph or generated by artificial intelligence. To achieve this, we will build a complete end-to-end pipeline: collecting and describing the dataset, preprocessing and preparing the images, extracting relevant features, training classification models, and evaluating their performance. The aim is to explore how machine learning can support digital authenticity and contribute to future systems that automatically detect AI-generated visual content.

## Datasets
During the early stages of the project, we examined several datasets containing AI-generated images and real photographs. However, most available datasets presented two main problems.

First, many of them were extremely large, often containing more than one hundred thousand images. While these datasets are excellent for large-scale research, they are impractical for a student project because they require very long download times, considerable storage space, and significant computing power for preprocessing and training.

Second, smaller datasets we found were not suitable for our needs. Many of them lacked diversity, included too few samples, or only focused on a specific type of image, such as human faces. Others had poor labeling quality or did not match the kind of modern AI-generated content we wanted to study.

Because of these issues, we decided to use a large and diverse dataset from Hugging Face:
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Hemg/AI-Generated-vs-Real-Images-Datasets

This dataset originally contained 152,710 images divided into two classes. The first class contains AI-generated content, identified under the name “AiArtData”. The second class contains real images created or captured by humans, listed under the name “RealArt”. The dataset includes a wide variety of subjects such as landscapes, objects, people, paintings, and synthetic scenes created by generative models. This diversity makes it particularly relevant to our objective, since today’s generative AI is capable of producing almost any type of visual content.

However, using the full dataset was not necessary for our project. To build a more manageable and balanced dataset, we wrote a Python script that automatically loads the full dataset, separates the images according to their labels, randomly selects a subset of 4000 AI-generated images and 4000 real images, converts every image to RGB format, and finally saves them into two folders. The result is a reduced dataset of 8000 images, perfectly balanced and much easier to work with during model training.

Below is the code used to create this reduced dataset.

    import os
    import random
    from datasets import load_dataset

    def main():
    ds = load_dataset("Hemg/AI-Generated-vs-Real-Images-Datasets")
    train = ds["train"]

    print(train)
    print("Features:", train.features)

    label_field = "label"

    label_names = train.features[label_field].names
    ai_label = label_names.index("AiArtData")
    real_label = label_names.index("RealArt")

    print("AI label:", ai_label, "(", label_names[ai_label], ")")
    print("Real label:", real_label, "(", label_names[real_label], ")")

    ai_indices = []
    real_indices = []

    for idx in range(len(train)):
        lbl = train[idx][label_field]
        if lbl == ai_label:
            ai_indices.append(idx)
        elif lbl == real_label:
            real_indices.append(idx)

    print("Total AI images:", len(ai_indices))
    print("Total Real images:", len(real_indices))

    random.seed(42)
    ai_sample = random.sample(ai_indices, 4000)
    real_sample = random.sample(real_indices, 4000)

    os.makedirs("dataset/AI", exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs("dataset/Real", exist_ok=True)

    for i, idx in enumerate(ai_sample):
        img = train[idx]["image"]
        if img.mode != "RGB":
            img = img.convert("RGB")
        img.save(f"dataset/AI/ai_{i:04d}.jpg")

    for i, idx in enumerate(real_sample):
        img = train[idx]["image"]
        if img.mode != "RGB":
            img = img.convert("RGB")
        img.save(f"dataset/Real/real_{i:04d}.jpg")

   
    if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
