# GP01-AI-and-Application-project
This project aims to predict football match outcomes (win, draw, or loss) based on team statistics using machine learning techniques. Using the “European Soccer Database” from Kaggle, we will preprocess and analyze data from multiple European leagues between 2008 and 2016. Key features such as goals scored, possession, shots, and home/away advantage will be used to train different classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors using scikit-learn. The project will also explore feature importance to identify which factors most influence match results. Evaluation metrics like accuracy and F1-score will be used to compare models. Finally, results will be visualized to show patterns in team performance. This work will demonstrate how AI can be applied to sports analytics to better understand and predict football outcomes.
